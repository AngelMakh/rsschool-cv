Given a lottery ticket (ticket), represented by an array of 2-value arrays, you must find out if you've won the jackpot.
```
function bingo(ticket, win){
let miniWins = 0;
let stringCodes = ticket.map( subarray => Array.from(subarray[0]).map(letter => letter.charCodeAt()));
for (let i = 0; stringCodes[i]; i++) {
if(stringCodes[i].includes(ticket[i][1])) {
miniWins++;
}
}
return miniWins >= win ? "Winner!" : "Loser!";
}
```

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
```
let countBits = function(num){
let oneInBinary = 0;
let n = num;
while (n) {
if (n % 2 === 1) oneInBinary++;
n = Math.floor(n / 2);
}
return oneInBinary;
};
/* one more solution
const countBits = (num) => {
let numInBinary = Array.from(num.toString(2));
let i;
i = numInBinary.filter(char => char === "1");
return i.length;
} */

```
